<div id="projectPageDescriptionGeneral" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Possessing a strong foundation, both academically and professionally, in Computer Science, this is a list of my major projects since my under graduation at NIT Trichy.</div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionAmazon" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Worked on various feature development including authentication and purchase flows for platforms including Youview, Sony Bravia, etc. Earned ownership over Sony Bravia, a platform serving more than a million customers. Independently developed IMDB module for a service responding to Amazon Instant Video client applications. Attained proficiency in various client operations such as video streaming, interface development, clickstream analysis, multimedia caching, etc. Currently entrusted to undertake the feasibility research of a cutting edge interface for high performance HTML5 devices.</div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionDred" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Improved Random Early Detection that uses Error Diffusion technique when computing probability of dropping the packets during network congestion. Diffused RED algorithm is experimented using Network Simulator that resulted in a reduced variance of Average queue size and a better trade-off for Utilization vs Mean queuing delay than actual RED algorithm.</div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionResearch" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Presented and Published two papers at IEEE International Conferences. Undergraduate thesis is currently under review for publication.<br/><div class="projectsButtonList"><a class="projectsButton" href="#publications"><span class="projectsButtonText">Go to publications</a></div></div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionMicrosoft" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Worked on Microsoft’s Email Interchange Azure Project, implementing, performance testing and analyzing impacts of Traffic Manager for the service, thus cost saving $34,000 p.a. Conducted a brown bag on my architecture and obtaining team’s buy for next version release.</div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionRaytracer" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">A C++ three-dimensional object renderer that achieves visual realism, requiring an advanced understanding of Optics and Coordinate geometry to construct, was implemented using the widely acknowledged backwards ray tracing algorithm.</div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionPragyanCMS" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Contributed for a full-featured modular CMS using PHP5 and MySQL that powers NIT-T’s internet and intranet websites. Developed modules, widgets and templates for the project.</div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionStock" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Contributed for virtual stock market application built using Django, PHP, MySQL for an online event ‘Dalal street’ which features buy, sell, trade and mortgaging shares between players.</div>
<div id="projectPageDescriptionOthers" class="projectPageDescriptionChildren">Implemented several <b>Language Models and Translators</b> as part of the Natural Language Processing course on Coursera using Python (submissions went through rigorous testing before acceptance)<br/><b>Bayesian Classifier</b> for Salary Prediction of outgoing students based on several parameters<br/>Parallel Simulation of <b>Triple DES encryption</b> algorithm on a 2D Mesh Architecture</div>
