Experimental setup, using Message Passing Interface, produced near-optimal task assignments (>90%) in all representative test cases obtained at roughly one-third effort of the sequential task assignment algorithm.<br/><span style="font-style:italic">Conference:</span> IEEE - International Conference on Computer & Information Science, 2012<br/><span style="font-style:italic">Authors:</span> Mohan, R.; Gopalan, N.P. ; Prasanth, S.H.D. ; Sanyam, S.; Varma, S.R.</p></div></div>

A detailed study of factors and parameters involved in the algorithm was conducted to discover suitable environments that can make best use of the algorithm.<br/><span style="font-style:italic">Conference:</span> IEEE - International Conference on Circuits, Power and Computing Technologies, 2013<br/><span style="font-style:italic">Author:</span> Prasanth, S.H.D.</p></div></div>

Diffused RED algorithm was experimented using Network Simulator which resulted in a reduced variance of Average queue size and a better trade-off for ‘Utilization vs Mean queuing delay’ than actual RED algorithm.<br/><span style="font-style:italic">Paper:</span> Under conference review.
